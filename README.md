**“We store the seed, not the tree.”**

NORTH = Nexus Orient Resonance Topography Harmonic  
A new class of information architecture where data is not compressed — it is **regenerated**.

Instead of storing the final artifact, NORTH extracts its **topological eigenvector** (Northpole)
and reconstructs the original perfectly:

> **D = Ψ(Ω₀, N(D))**  
> *(Original data = substrate + structural code)*

A human is not a compressed image.  
A human is the execution of genetic code.  
NORTH applies this principle to digital information.
